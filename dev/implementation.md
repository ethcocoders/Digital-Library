### **Implementation Plan: Modern Digital Library System**

This document outlines the technical implementation details for the "Modern Digital Library System."

#### **1. Technology Stack**

*   **Backend:** Python with Flask. It's lightweight, powerful, and a good choice for this project's scale.
*   **Database:** SQLite. It's simple, serverless, and perfect for a project of this size. We'll use Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM.
*   **Frontend:** React.js. It's a robust and popular library for building modern, component-based user interfaces.
*   **Styling:** CSS with Material-UI. This will provide a professional, pre-designed component library to ensure a high-quality, aesthetic finish.
*   **Containerization:** Docker. To ensure a consistent development and deployment environment.

#### **2. Backend Implementation**

*   **API:** A RESTful API will be designed to handle all communication between the frontend and backend.
*   **Authentication:** I'll use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless authentication.
*   **Database Models:**
    *   `User`: Stores user credentials and profile information.
    *   `SystemFile`: Represents files and folders in the system catalogue.
    *   `CustomFile`: Represents user-uploaded files and folders.
*   **File Storage:**
    *   System files will be stored in `Source/System/`.
    *   User-uploaded files will be stored in `Source/Custom/`.

#### **3. Frontend Implementation**

*   **Component Structure:** The UI will be broken down into reusable React components.
*   **State Management:** I'll use React's built-in state management (useState, useContext) for simplicity.
*   **PDF Viewer:** I'll integrate a library like `react-pdf` to handle the in-app PDF viewing.
*   **Theming:** Material-UI's theming capabilities will be used to implement the light/dark mode toggle.
